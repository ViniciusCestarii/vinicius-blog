Welcome to my blog! I wanted to take a moment to share the journey that led to its creation and what you can expect from my posts.

## The inspiration

This blog was born from my passion for **creating** and sharing knowledge. I recognized a need to document and share what Iâ€™ve learned, so I decided to build a platform where I could have full control over the content. Here are some of the key features I implemented:

- **Storage Visualization** - Easily see the status of each post.
- **User Engagement:** - Allow readers to like posts and interact with the content.
- **Admin Access** - Manage posts from anywhere, ensuring I can keep the blog updated on the go.

## Tech Stack

Choosing the right technologies was crucial for me. I focused on three main concerns:

- **Developer and User Experience** - I aimed for a seamless experience for both myself as a developer and my readers.
- **Speed** - I prioritized tools that would allow for quick development, avoiding those with steep learning curves.
- **Learning Opportunities** - I wanted to finish this project with new skills and insights that I could share with others.
